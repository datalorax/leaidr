The goal of leaidr is to provide an easy way to map U.S. school districts in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ivelasq/leaidr")
```

## About

The original shapefiles can be found on the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries) site. These files are from 2019.

We'll work on adding state names/abbreviation so we don't have to use FIPS.

## Load the U.S. Shapefile

Load the shapefile for the entire U.S. using `load_shapefile()`. It may take a while - the large .shp was uploaded to Github using {piggyback}. Once you have loaded it, you shouldn't have to do it again unless you delete the package.

## Create a Shapefile

Run the function `create_shapefile()` to create a shapefile with district boundaries. If you want the entire U.S., then designate `fips = "All"`. If you want a specific state, then designate it with the state abbrevation `fips = "47`. To designate multiple states, designate it in a vector `fips = c("47", "06")`.

## Use the Data

Once you have the shapefile, you can merge other data using `merge()`. You can also plot the shapefiles in {leaflet} and {ggplot2}.

### Leaflet Example

```{r}
library(leaidr)
library(leaflet)

# if you haven't loaded the shapefile
# load_shapefile()

tn <- create_shapefile(fips = "47")

leaflet(tn) %>% 
  addPolygons(weight = 0.3, 
              smoothFactor = 0.5,
              opacity = 1.0, 
              color = "white") %>% 
  setView(-86.5804, 35.5175, zoom = 6)
```

### ggplot2 Example

```{r, dpi = 300}
library(leaidr)
library(tidyverse)

# if you haven't loaded the shapefile
# load_shapefile()

tn <- create_shapefile(fips = "47")
tn_df <- ggplot2::fortify(tn)

map <-
  ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = tn, 
            aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
            color = "gray", size = .2) +
  theme_void()

map_projected <- map +
  coord_map()

print(map_projected)
```
